# üç≤ Ghanaian Food Recognition Models

This repository contains deep learning models trained to classify **traditional Ghanaian dishes** using image data. It includes implementations of **MobileNetV2**, **ResNet**, **VGG16**, **VGG19**, and **Google Inception**, with the goal of comparing performance across architectures and promoting culturally relevant AI applications.

These models can support use cases in **restaurant tech, food delivery, nutrition tracking**, and **cultural preservation** through computer vision.
